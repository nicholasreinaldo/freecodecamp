# Types of JavaScript Data Types
Here are the following Data types that i've learned so far:
- Undefined
- Null
- Boolean
- String
- Symbol
- Bigint
- Number
- Object
- Array
- Date
- Function
- Map
- Set
- RegExp
- Error
## Undefined
The value of undefined represents an uninitialized, non-existent, or missing value. It is a primitive data type in JavaScript. When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value is undefined.
