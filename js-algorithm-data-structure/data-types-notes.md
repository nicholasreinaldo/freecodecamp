# Types of JavaScript Data Types
Here are the following Data types that I've learned so far:
- Undefined
- Null
- Boolean
- String
- Symbol
- BigInt
- Number
- Object
- Array
- Date
- Function
- Map
- Set
- RegExp
- Error
## Undefined
The value of undefined represents an uninitialized, non-existent, or missing value. It is a primitive data type in JavaScript. When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value is undefined.
## Null
The value of null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is also a primitive data type in JavaScript. It is used to indicate that a variable intentionally does not have a value or that an object reference does not refer to a valid object.
## Boolean
The Boolean data type represents a logical value that can be either true or false. It is used to perform logical operations, conditions, and comparisons in JavaScript. Boolean values are often the result of conditional expressions or comparisons.
## String
The string data type represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes. It is used to store and manipulate text in JavaScript. Strings can be concatenated, sliced, and transformed using various built-in methods.
## Symbol
The symbol data type was introduced in ECMAScript 6 and represents a unique and immutable value. Symbols are often used as keys for object properties to ensure their uniqueness. Each symbol value is unique and cannot be replicated.
## BigInt
The BigInt data type was introduced in ECMAScript 2020 and is used to represent integers with arbitrary precision. It is helpful when dealing with numbers that exceed the limit of the Number data type. BigInt values are created by appending 'n' to the end of an integer or by using the BigInt() constructor.

Use BigInts when:
- Working with very large integers: If you need to perform operations on integers that exceed the maximum safe integer value (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER), BigInts are necessary to represent and manipulate those numbers accurately.
- Requiring precise decimal arithmetic: When dealing with decimal arithmetic that requires exact precision, such as financial calculations or cryptography algorithms, BigInts can provide the necessary level of accuracy without rounding errors.
- Working with libraries or APIs that support BigInt: If you are using libraries or APIs that natively support BigInts or require their use, you should use BigInts to maintain compatibility and ensure accurate results.

Do not use BigInts when:
- Dealing with floating-point numbers: BigInts are not designed to work with decimal fractions or floating-point numbers. For such cases, the Number data type or libraries like Decimal.js are more appropriate.
- Needing performance optimization: BigInts are generally slower and consume more memory compared to regular Number operations. If you are working with integers within the safe range of the Number data type and don't require arbitrary precision, using regular Numbers will result in better performance.
- Operating with mixed data types: BigInts cannot be mixed directly with regular Numbers, and operations involving both data types can be cumbersome. If you need to perform calculations with mixed data types, consider converting BigInts to regular Numbers or finding alternative solutions.

## Number
The number data type represents numeric values, including integers, floating-point numbers, and special numeric values such as Infinity and NaN (Not-a-Number). Numbers are used for arithmetic operations, calculations, and mathematical computations in JavaScript.
## Object
The object data type represents a collection of key-value pairs and is one of the most fundamental data types in JavaScript. Objects can store and organize data of different types and are created using curly braces ({}) or the Object constructor. Objects can have properties and methods that allow for complex data structures and behavior.
## Array
## Date
## Function
## Map
## Set
## RegExp
## Error
