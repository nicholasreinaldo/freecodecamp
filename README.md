# freeCodeCamp
Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio pages from freeCodeCamp Portfolio

## Introduction
freeCodeCamp is an online interactive learning web platform where you learn as you do, here I learned so many new things and make this as the first roadmap that I used to become a software developer. Each of their curriculum courses have their respective interactive and self checking projects which I did on the lists below. Learn more about freeCodeCamp [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). 

## Responsive Web Page
The first course I've learned at freeCodeCamp, here I learned about HTML & CSS, how to make a web page look good on all devices (Desktop, Tablet & Phone).
My certification credentials could be accessed at [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc7893bab6-3711-4212-94ab-b864ee8f730d/responsive-web-design).
